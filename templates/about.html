<p>
    The formation of the group grew out of a meeting Gandalf had with Thorin in Bree which kindled Thorin's interest in
    recapturing his long lost family inheritance. (Thorin's grandfather had been the king of the Lonely Mountain when
    Smaug came and took it.) Remembering that he had once known an adventurous Hobbit on his travels in the Shire,
    Gandalf decided to add Bilbo to their company because he knew that stealth and cunning were preferable to force.
    Gandalf also believed that someone like Bilbo could keep the sometimes prideful and stubborn Dwarves from rash
    action. The superstitious Dwarves also considered thirteen to be an unlucky number, and as Gandalf had planned to
    leave on other business, welcomed a fourteenth to fill into their party.

        <h3>Thorin II Oakensheild</h3>
        <p>
            In the year TA 2746, Thorin II was born to Dwarven prince Thráin II in the mountain city of The Lonely
            Mountain. Early in his youth, he and the other Dwarves of the Lonely Mountain were forced to flee by the
            dragon Smaug in TA 2770. While in exile, he quickly grew to become a capable warrior. This was demonstrated
            when he participated in the Battle of Azanulbizar in TA 2799. He marched with one of the Dwarven armies
            beneath the East-gate of Moria. At some point in the fighting, his shield broke, and using an oaken tree
            branch found on the floor as a shield, he gained the epithet "Oakenshield," which would remain with him even
            in death.

        <h3>Fíli and Kíli</h3>
        <p>
            Fíli and Kíli were nephews of Thorin, who was the elder brother of their mother Dís. They were also nephews
            of Frerin, grandsons of Thráin II, and great-grandsons of Thrór. Fíli's most distinguishing feature was his
            long nose, the longest of any of the Dwarves in Thorin's company.
            <br><br>
            As the youngest Dwarves, Fíli and Kíli had the sharpest eyes, and were often sent scouting or searching. It
            was they that found the Front Porch while in the Misty Mountains.
            <br><br>
            With the other Dwarves, Fíli and Kíli encountered spiders and were later imprisoned by the Elvenking
            Thranduil. They escaped the cells thanks to Bilbo, traveling down the river in barrels until they reached
            Lake-town. The brothers accompanied Thorin and Bilbo to Lake-town while the others rested by the
            river.
            <br><br>
            At the feet of the Lonely Mountain, Fíli and Kíli scouted Ravenhill and found the Front Gate with Balin and
            Bilbo. Also, with Bilbo, they found the side-door leading into the mountain.
            <br><br>
            Both brothers were killed while defending the mortally wounded Thorin Oakenshield in the Battle of Five
            Armies, and all three were buried with honor

        <h3>Óin</h3>
        <p>
            Óin was the older brother of Glóin, cousin of Dwalin and Balin, and uncle of Gimli. Oin's uncle was King
            Fundin, the father of Balin and Dwalin. He usually wore a brown-hooded cloak when travelling. Óin fought in
            the Battle of Azanulbizar along with Thorin Oakenshield, and in TA 2941 joined with Thorin and Company on
            the quest to reclaim the Lonely Mountain wearing a brown hood. Óin was one of the Dwarves who bet that Bilbo
            would come along with them to reclaim the Lonely Mountain. Óin and his brother Glóin were usually in charge
            of preparing the fire for the Company as they were the most skilled out of the others. He fought in and
            survived the Battle of the Five Armies, and later settled in the Lonely Mountain with King Dain Ironfoot II
            along with many other dwarves of The Company of Thorin.

        <h3>Glóin</h3>
        <p>
            Glóin was born in TA 2783, after the Dragon Smaug desolated Erebor. He was the younger child of Gróin and
            younger brother of Óin.

            In TA 2799, Glóin was known to have fought in the Battle of Azanulbizar, the last battle of the War of the
            Dwarves and Orcs, though it is unknown what significance he did, being 16 years old.

            In TA 2879, in the Blue Mountains, while in exile, his son Gimli was born to him and an unknown wife. In
            March of TA 2941 in Bree, Thorin Oakenshield met by chance the wizard Gandalf the Grey, pushing Thorin to
            reclaim Erebor, so that Smaug wouldn't start an alliance with Sauron. When Gandalf mentioned hobbits, Glóin
            referred them as "simpletons" and also said that hobbits "would never dare to come within smelling distance
            of the nakedest dragonet new from the shell"

        <h3>Balin</h3>
        <p>
            Balin was a Dwarf leader, the son of Fundin, and elder brother of Dwalin. He was one of the thirteen Dwarves
            who accompanied Thorin II Oakenshield on the quest to regain the Lonely Mountain.
            A Dwarf Lord known for his wise counsel and willingness to listen, he was one of Thorin's closest friends
            and advisers. Balin was distantly related to him, and a descendant of the noble house of Durin.

            He later went to re-establish the kingdom of Moria, but within five years it was overcome once more by Orcs,
            and he was killed there along with the rest of his companions.

            Baggins and Thorin Oakenshield as a member of Thorin's Company on the Quest for Erebor, to reclaim the
            Lonely Mountain from the dragon Smaug.

            Dori was among the Dwarves at Bag End who joined in singing about "blunting the knives" and "bending the
            forks"; as well as accompanying by playing the flute. He was described as “decent fellow despite his
            grumbling”. He often wore a red-violet coat while on the Quest for Erebor. He was noted by Thorin to be the
            strongest of the thirteen companions.

            Bifur was a Dwarf of the late-Third Age. He is best known for being a companion to Bilbo Baggins and Thorin
            Oakenshield on the quest to regain the Lonely Mountain, along with his cousins Bofur and Bombur. Whilst he
            was a descendant of the Dwarves of Khazad-dûm, Bifur was not of Durin's Folk. Most of his familial relations
            are unclear, and what is known of his parentage is very little. He and his family were driven out of their
            home in the Lonely Mountain by the Dragon Smaug, and were forced to live in exile, where the Dwarf warrior
            worked as a toy maker. Following Thorin II Oakenshield to a new life in the Blue Mountains, he continued his
            life as a toy maker.

            Oakenshield and Gandalf on the quest to reclaim Lonely Mountain from the dragon Smaug, along with his
            brother Bombur and cousin Bifur. Bofur's heritage is unclear, but he was not of Durin's Folk. He and his
            family hailed from the Blue Mountains. As such, they felt less strongly about the quest to reclaim the
            Lonely Mountain from the dragon Smaug, more interested in the adventure than a home they'd never seen.

        <h3>Bombur</h3>
        <p>
            Bombur was a Dwarf who accompanied Thorin Oakenshield and Bilbo Baggins on their journey to the Lonely
            Mountain as part of the company, alongside his brother Bofur and cousin Bifur. Bombur was noted as the
            fattest Dwarf in the company. Bombur's parentage is unknown. He is the brother of Bofur and cousin of Bifur.
            Bombur was not of Durin's line, although he was descended from the Dwarves of Moria. His birth date is
            unknown, though it fell somewhere between TA 2763 and TA 2859; the brothers Fíli and Kíli were the youngest
            of the thirteen "by some fifty years," and, after Thorin was captured, Balin was "the eldest left." Fíli was
            born in TA 2859, and Balin was born in TA 2763. Bombur was thus roughly 150 years old during the quest.
            Prior to the journey, Bombur likely resided in the Blue Mountains alongside Thorin, after the loss of Thráin
            II.

        <p>
            Bilbo Baggins was a hobbit of the Shire, the main protagonist of The Hobbit and a secondary character in The
            Lord of the Rings. Gandalf suggested to Thorin and Company that they hire Bilbo Baggins to be their burglar
            in
            the Quest of Erebor, and later fought in the Battle of Five Armies. Bilbo was also one of the bearers of the
            One
            Ring, and the first
            to voluntarily give it up, although with some difficulty. He wrote many of his adventures in a book he
            called
            There and Back Again. Bilbo adopted his second-cousin-once-removed Frodo Baggins to be his heir after his
            parents, Drogo Baggins and Primula Brandybuck, drowned in the Brandywine River. Bilbo was the first hobbit
            to
            become famous in the world at large, and one of the few to set foot in the Undying
            Lands.
